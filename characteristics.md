Equipment used to evaluate characteristics.

- A tensile testing machine [(Instron Model 3369)](https://www.instron.us/products/testing-systems/universal-testing-systems/electromechanical/3300/3360-dual-column) was employed for cyclic tests.
- The electrical resistance was measured using a digital multimeter [(34465A, Keysight Technologies)](https://www.keysight.com/en/pdx-2891457-pn-34465A/digital-multimeter-6-digit-truevolt-dmm?cc=AU&lc=eng).


Maximum sensing range and cyclic reliability: a strain of 58%

Cyclic tests:
- Cyclic tests are conducted by applying a sinusoidal cyclic load to stretch the sensor at a frequency of 0.08 Hz. 
- cycle_test.png shows the the resistance changes of 1,000 times of cyclic loading and unloading of a maximum strain of 20%.

Sensitivity: 
- Gauge Factor of 103.8
- response_figure.png shows the relationship between resistance changes and loaded strain. The linear fitting coefficients R<sup>2</sup> of 0.974 implies the response of the sensor is almost perfect linear.
- Sensitivity between the stretched length and corresponding resistance changes: 306 kΩ/mm.

Hysteresis: ~3% shown in hysteresis.png

Transparency: The optical transmittance by ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry is higher than 40% in the wavelength range of 350 to 850 nm as shown in transparency.png
