The fabricated prototype sensor has maximum sensing range $\epsilon_{max}$ of 58\%, and the sensitivity GF of 103.8. To examine the stability of mechanical properties, the cyclic tests are conducted by applying a sinusoidal cyclic load to stretch the sensor at a frequency of 0.08 Hz. A tensile testing machine (Instron Model 3369) was employed for this test to characterize the mechanical properties. The electrical resistance was measured using a digital multimeter (34465A, Keysight Technologies). Figure~\ref{fig:cyclic_test} shows the resistance changes of 1,000 times of cyclic loading and unloading of a maximum strain of 20\%. The cyclic reliability of our sensor is comparable to reported sensors in other recent researches~\cite{lee2018highly, wu2018ultrasensitive}, showing that the sensors have a good working stability against a highly frequent strain applied on them.

The degree of hysteresis (~ 3\%) shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:hysteresis} can be evaluated by using the ratio of the width of the hysteresis loop to the range during the loading-unloading cycle. The optical transmittance by ultravioletâ€“visible spectrophotometry is higher than 40\% in the wavelength range of 350 to 850 nm as shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:transparency}. The sensor itself can work in different aqueous conditions. However, the electrical part including copper wires attached to silver pastes, and embedded system for signal processing cannot be laundered.
