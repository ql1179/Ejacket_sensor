The fabrication process of the sensor is as follows.

1. We treated PDMS films with about 200 $\mu m$ thickness using $O_2$ plasma for 10 minutes. As the result, we derive a thin layer of oxidized hydrophilic PDMS.
2. We coated a conductive thin films of PEDOT/CNFs on to the surface of oxidized hydrophilic PDMS by drop casting.
3. We baked the coated PEDOT/CNFs at 60$^{\circ}$ for 5 hours to enhance the adhesion of the the PEDOT/CNFs layer.
4. Two silver paste as well as a pair of copper wires attached onto them was applied at the both ends of the conductive film for electrical measurements.
5. We encapsulated another layer of PDMS onto the conductive thin films.
